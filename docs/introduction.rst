Introduction
************

OpenFermion-FQE is an emulator for quantum computing specialized for simulations of Fermionic many-body problems,
where FQE stands for 'Fermionic quantum emulator.' By focusing on Fermionic physics,
OpenFermion-FQE realizes far more efficient emulation of quantum computing than generic quantum emulators such as Cirq,
both in computation and memory costs; the speed-up and improved memory footprint originate from the use of the spin and
number symmetries and highly optimized special algorithms.

The examples of the problems that can be simulated by OpenFermion-FQE include those in molecular electronic structure,
condensed matter physics, and nuclear physics.

The initial version of OpenFermion-FQE has been developed in collaboration between `QSimulate <https://qsimulate.com>`_ and
`Google AI Quantum <https://research.google/teams/applied-science/quantum/>`_.
The source code is found in the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/quantumlib/OpenFermion-FQE>`_.
